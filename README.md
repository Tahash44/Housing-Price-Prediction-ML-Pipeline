🏠 Housing Price Prediction & Analysis
This repository contains the complete machine learning pipeline developed for in-depth analysis and forecasting of real estate prices. It chronicles the journey from raw data to final predictive models, including debugging and refinement steps.

✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive scripts for cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering on housing datasets.
ML Modeling: Implementation and comparison of various regression algorithms for accurate price prediction.
Advanced Visualization: Generation of key visual outputs (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to interpret feature relationships and model performance.
Debugging Log: Documentation of overcoming execution errors (OSError) through the use of mock data simulation to ensure pipeline integrity.
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the analysis locally:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Execution
Clone the repository:
bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tahash44/Housing-Price-Prediction.git
    cd Housing-Price-Prediction
Run the main notebook:
Open and execute the primary analysis notebook (e.g., analysis_notebook.ipynb).
